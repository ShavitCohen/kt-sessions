      HP SiteScope comes with solution templates for monitoring IT infrastructure elements, including Oracle, Microsoft

      settings that are optimized for monitoring the availability, performance, and health of the target application or
      system. For example, the solutions for Microsoft Exchange monitoring include performance counter, event log, MAPI,
      and Exchange application specific monitor types.[12]
