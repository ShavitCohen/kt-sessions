      HP SiteScope tests a web page or a series of web pages using synthetic monitoring.[5] However, it is not limited
      to
      web applications and can be used to monitor database servers (Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server, etc.), Unix
      servers, Microsoft Windows servers and many other types of hardware and software. It can export the collected data
      in real time to HP LoadRunner or it can be used.

      HP SiteScope comes with solution templates for monitoring IT infrastructure elements, including Oracle, Microsoft

      Solution templates deploy a combination of standard SiteScope monitor types and solution-specific monitors with
      settings that are optimized for monitoring the availability, performance, and health of the target application or
      system. For example, the solutions for Microsoft Exchange monitoring include performance counter, event log, MAPI,
      and Exchange application specific monitor types.[12]
